If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

    a + b + c = p
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

    We can fix c and then vary a/b
    p - c = a + b

    How to find (a, b)? Can we do binary search?
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    We have c^2
    a,b can be swapped WLG
    Idea: Maybe we can start with a = b = (p - c)/2 (break if any non ints involved)
    - If the sum is too high (a^2 + b^2 > c^2)

    p = 12
    c = 2 (loop var)
    a = b = (p - c) / 2 = (12 - 2) / 2 = 5
    This would mean 5^2 + 5^2 = 2^2... obviously untrue
    We can vary a,b to the following values:
    4, 6 => 4^2 + 6^2 = 52
    3, 7 => 3^2 + 7^2 = 58
    2, 8 => 2^2 + 8^2 = 68
    1, 9 => 1^2 + 9^2 = 82

    From this it would appear that starting with a = b yields the lowest possible value
    and that a = 1, b = (p - c) / 2 - 1 yields the highest possible value. I think
    binary search is applicable here.

    Given this the algorithm's runtime can be described in the following way:

    Loop 1 -> 1000 (called n):                 O(1)
        Loop 1 -> n (called c):                O(n^2)
            Binary search for (a, b)           O(log(c))

    Question: Can there be multiple solutions (a, b) where a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ?
    It feels like the answer is yes. If you draw one side of a triangle (hypotenuse),
    have you fixed the location of where (a, b) meet, and therefore their lengths? It
    seems like it..?

    Given p, what is the highest number we need to check for c?
    It is certain that c < p/2, because the sum of any two sides of a triangle
    is greater than the length of the third side. Additionally,
    If c = p/2, that means that a^2 + b^2 =?= c^2 where a + b = c.
    This will never be the case, so that's a starting point.

    Given p, what is the lowest number we need to check for c?
    If c = p/3, then a = b = c. This is an equilateral triangle, where
    all angles are 60deg. If we want one of the angles to be bigger (i.e., 90deg),
    we need to lengthen one of the sides (i.e., the hypotenuse).

    It would seem that we can check c where p/3 < c < p/2.
