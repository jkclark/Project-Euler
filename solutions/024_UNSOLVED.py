'''
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of
the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

    012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
