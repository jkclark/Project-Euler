[Problem 15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15) doesn't have a solution because it's a combinatorics question.

I really liked solving [problem 54](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54) because I saw a clean way of organizing it via OOP.

[Problem 76](https://projecteuler.net/problem=76) was really fun to think about and to solve. I feel like it was a very appropriate level of difficulty for me.
